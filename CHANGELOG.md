# v2.0.0 Intel® Geti™ SDK (16-05-2024)
## New features
This release introduces a new feature related to model deployment: post-inference hooks! A post-inference hook can be added to any `Deployment`, and will be executed after every inference request (i.e. every call to `deployment.infer()`). The hooks allow you to define specific actions to take under certain conditions. For example, a hook could implement the following behaviour:
**If** the confidence level of one of the predictions for the image is less than 20%, **then** upload the image to the Intel® Geti™ project in which the model was trained.

This could be useful for improving your model with a next training round, because including such 'low confidence images' in the training dataset might help to improve model accuracy.
Additional examples of post-inference hooks, and instructions for configuring them, can be found in the newly added [notebook 012](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/geti-sdk/blob/main/notebooks/012_post_inference_hooks.ipynb) in this repository.

## Breaking changes
This major release of the Intel® Geti™ SDK breaks backwards compatibility with Intel® Geti™ servers of version v1.14 and below. Please make sure that your Intel® Geti™ server is updated to the latest version of the Intel® Geti™ platform, to prevent compatibility issues.

# v1.15.0 Intel® Geti™ SDK (12-03-2024)
This release makes the SDK compatible for Intel® Geti™ v1.15. The majority of the changes is focused on that, but below is a list of other changes that are worth mentioning.

## Release Highlights
- Add compatibility for Intel® Geti™ v1.15. Note that we maintain backwards compatibility for models created in Intel® Geti™ v1.8: This means that the SDK can run inference on deployments from both both the latest Intel® Geti™ on-prem release and Intel® Geti™ SaaS.
- Add benchmarking functionality for deployments through the `Benchmarker` class, as well as a new notebook to demonstrate this feature.
- Improve the job monitoring feature, job progression is now displayed via progress bars.
- Image and annotation upload and download now uses multithreading, greatly speeding up the process.
- A new notebook demonstrating an end-to-end workflow, from model creation to deployment, was added to `notebooks/use_cases`.
- Multiple dependency updates, minor bug fixes and documentation improvements.

## Breaking Changes
* The `Geti` class now has SSL certificate validation enabled by default. This will result in an error when connecting to a server with a certificate that can't be validated. Note that it is still possible to disable certificate validation by passing `verify_certificate = False` when initializing the `Geti` instance. Please note that disabling certificate validation is unsafe and should only be considered in a secure network environment.

# v0.2.0 Intel® Geti™ SDK (27-09-2022)

This is the first official release of the Intel® Geti™ Software Development Kit (SDK).

The purpose of this SDK is twofold:

1. Provide an easy-to-use interface to the [Intel® Geti™ platform](www.geti.intel.com), to manipulate
Intel® Geti™ projects and other entities or automate tasks on the platform. All
of this from a Python script or Jupyter notebook.


2. Provide an API to deploy and run models trained on the Intel® Geti™ server on your local
machine. The SDK Deployment module provides a straightforward
route to create a deployment for your Intel® Geti™ project, save it to a local disk and run
it offline.

This SDK includes various example scripts and Jupyter notebooks which illustrate a
range of use cases for the SDK. Make sure to check them out if you're getting
started!
