    "This notebook shows how to train a model for a task in the project. Model training is a slow, computationally heavy process which runs in background (job), so you can continue to interact with the platform, e.g. annotating more images, while the training job is still in progress. The notebook also shows how to monitor the progress of the job, and how to train with a different configuration."
